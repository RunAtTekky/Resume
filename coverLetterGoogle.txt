Dear HR,

I am writing to express my interest in the Summer Internship position starting in May/June 2025, as advertised. With my ongoing education in the field of Computer Science and my hands-on experience in programming and software development, I am eager to contribute to your esteemed organization while gaining invaluable professional experience.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at VIT (Vellore Institute of Technology) Bhopal. My academic background, combined with practical experience, has equipped me with a strong foundation in several programming languages, including Java, Python, and C++. My coursework has provided me with a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software design principles, which I have applied in various projects and assignments. Additionally, I have developed a solid grasp of working in Linux environments, which I understand is a critical skill for this internship.

During my studies, I have undertaken several projects that demonstrate my ability to tackle complex problems and develop effective solutions. For example, I developed a web application using JavaScript and integrated it with a backend server to manage data in real-time. Furthermore, I have explored distributed systems and parallel computing, which has enhanced my ability to work on scalable and efficient software systems. My involvement in computer science-related extracurricular activities, such as Competitive Programming, has further honed my technical and collaborative skills.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work at Google due to your commitment to innovation and excellence in technology. The chance to work on projects related to mobile development, machine learning, and other advanced fields aligns perfectly with my career aspirations. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to your team and learning from the talented professionals at Google.

I am flexible regarding the preferred working location and am open to opportunities in Bangalore, Hyderabad, or Pune. I have attached my updated resume and my current unofficial transcript for your review. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to your team during the internship.

Sincerely,
